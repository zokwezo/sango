# Sango Language Tools

This repository provides digital artifacts (code and data) intended to be useful in building
language models and tools for [Sango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sango_language)
(language code sg/sag), the national language of the Central African Republic.

> Note that this project addresses the national vernacular language of the CAR, and does not support
> Riverain Sango (sg/snj), a tribal dialect continuum which includes Yakoma (CAR) and Ngbandi (Congo).
